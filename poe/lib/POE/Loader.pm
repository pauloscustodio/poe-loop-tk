=head1 NAME

POE::Loader - load modules, preferring XS versions if available

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Loader qw(POE::Queue::Array);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TODO - As far as I know, this is not used anywhere.

POE supports XS versions of nearly all its mixin classes.  If
available, they are prefixed with POE::XS rather than POE.  This
POE::Loader class looks for POE::XS versions of the modules it's told
to load and falls back to the plain-Perl versions if they are not
avaibale.

Usage is simple:  use POE::Loader @list_of_modules_to_load.

=head1 BUGS

This module is a classic case of YDNI.  It was written well in advance
of any POE::XS modules.  To be fair, however, it was necessary to
write the loader to enable the XS modules, most of which remain
unwritten.

Design flaw aside, there are no known bugs in this module.
