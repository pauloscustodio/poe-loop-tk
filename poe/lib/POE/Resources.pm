=head1 NAME

POE::Resources - loader of POE resources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  POE::Resources->initialize(); # intended to be used within the kernel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Internally POE's kernel is split up into the different resources that it
manages.  Each resource may be handled by a pure perl module, or by an
XS module.  This module is used internally by the kernel to load the
correct modules.

For each resource type, initialize first tries to load C<POE::XS::Resource::*>
and then falls back to C<POE::Resource::*>.
