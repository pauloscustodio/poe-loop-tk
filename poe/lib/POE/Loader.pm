=head1 NAME

POE::Loader - load modules, preferring XS versions if available

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Loader qw(POE::Queue::Array);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE is designed to be installed without the need for a compiler.  All
base code and prerequisites are either pure Perl code, or come with
Perl itself.

Compiled code has certain advantages, so POE::Loader implements a
module loader that will prefer an XS module over the plain Perl
version, if the XS version is available.

The XS version begins with POE::XS rather than just POE.  For example,
L<POE::XS::Queue::Array>.  If it's installed, POE::Loader will find
and use it rather than POE::Queue::Array.

=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs in this module.
